    # There's a linux system command to find the size of a folder (I don't know an R command). Use system2 to create a shell and then run the command within that shell and then close that shell after the command runs. So I can run the system command "du"
    # "du" is the system command to estimate file space usage. the arguments for that command are "s" summarize. to display only a total for each argument and "m" for megabytes for file size

    # "|" pipe all of that into the cut function

    # make it a numeric using as.numeric because otherwise it's a string
    # divide by 1024 to make it in gigabytes. for some reason the du command doesn't have a g argument to make it in gigabytes at first, just an m for megabytes
